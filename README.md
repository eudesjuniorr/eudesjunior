# Hi, I'm Eudes Junior ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me
I'm a self-taught programmer with a passion for learning and building projects. I have a basic understanding of **Python** and **Java**, and I'm comfortable working with **HTML** and **CSS** for now. Currently, I'm studying **JavaScript** to further enhance my web development skills.

## Academic Background
I am currently in my third semester of the **Systems Analysis and Development Technology program** at the **Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Pernambuco (IFPE)**. This program has provided me with a solid foundation in software development, systems analysis, and other essential areas of information technology. My experience at IFPE has been instrumental in my academic and professional growth, allowing me to apply the knowledge gained in practical projects and develop critical skills for a career in IT.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python (Basic), Java (Basic), JavaScript (in progress)
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS and JS
- **Learning Approach:** Self-taught through hands-on projects and practice

## Projects
I have a few basic projects on my GitHub that showcase my learning journey:
- **Personal Tech Blog**: A straightforward personal blog project focused on sharing insights about programming, technology, and software development. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScriptâ€”with content managed via Markdownâ€”it features an organized structure with reusable components, templates, and static assets. This project reflects a self-taught approach to web development and serves as a great starting point for sharing tech knowledge.
- **ChatTime Plugin**: A SpongeForge plugin built in Java for Minecraft servers. It enhances in-game chat by automatically adding timestamps to messages and displaying a welcoming message whenever a player joins the server. This lightweight tool improves communication and the overall player experience.
